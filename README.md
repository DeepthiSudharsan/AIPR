[^1]: This fun little project started off as a joke about my laziness. I had printed one document for studying so I can read it whenever I want and wherever I want but eventually realized that the document consisted of way too many hyperlinks to different references which I need to visit and learn to get a good grasp of the discussion in the document. But this meant that I had to use some device yet again. And this was my 30-minute solution to such a silly thing!
